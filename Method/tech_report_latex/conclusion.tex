In this study, we introduce Dive2Protein, a flexible deep neural network architecture able to predict retention times and
tandem mass spectrometry spectra of peptides and that substantially surpass current
benchmarks and tools. Although trained on tryptic peptides from human origin, it performed very well with all proteases,
organisms, datasets, mass spectrometers and acquisition parameters tested here. This highlights that the learned internal
representation of Dive2Protein approximates a chemo-physical model for peptide fragmentation and chromatographic retention time.
However, it is also clear that including more non-tryptic data or longer peptides as well as higher charge states would
most probably further improve prediction accuracy.

Our collaborator's results demonstrate that predicted spectral libraries can be used for analyzing DIA data. While predicted
libraries performed slightly worse than high-quality experimental spectral libraries, replacing lower quality
spectral libraries by consistent and high signal-to-noise predicted spectra increased the number of identified
peptides by up to 10$\%$. In the future, Dive2Protein might enable the regeneration of libraries on instrument replacement
or calibration and potentially supports the consistent addition of new peptide hypothesis without compromising
the homogeneity of a library.
