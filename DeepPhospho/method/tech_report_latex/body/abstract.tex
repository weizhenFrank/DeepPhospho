   In mass-spectrometry-based proteomics, the identification and quantification of peptides and proteins heavily
   rely on sequence database searching or spectral library matching. The size and quality of sequence database is
   crucial for the searching. There are researches that propose we could build a virtual sequence database composed
   of the peptide sequence with its retention time and spectra by computational method. Nowadays, the deep learning
   model has show its power in computer vision and natural language processing,
   however, in proteomics, the
   lack of accurate predictive models for
   fragment ion intensities and retention time impairs the realization of the full potential of these proposals.
   Here, we propose
   our new method DeepPhospho, based on LSTM-Transformer model and focus on the phosphorylation peptide data, especially.
   Using our model, researchers could build a larger and more
   accurate peptide library for protein identification in mass-spectrometry-based proteomics.
