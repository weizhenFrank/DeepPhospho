In this study, we introduce DeepPhospho, a flexible deep neural network based on the LSTM-Transformer architecture able to predict retention times and tandem mass spectrometry spectra of peptides and it substantially surpasses current methods in several datasets. We design our method target on the phosphorylated peptides.

Our collaborator's results demonstrate that predicted spectral libraries can be used for analyzing DIA data. While predicted
libraries performed slightly worse than high-quality experimental spectral libraries, replacing lower quality
spectral libraries by consistent and high signal-to-noise predicted spectra increased the number of identified
peptides by up to 10$\%$. In the future, DeepPhospho might enable the regeneration of libraries on instrument replacement
or calibration and potentially supports the consistent addition of new peptide hypothesis without compromising
the homogeneity of a library.
